# Git Commands to Run

Since git is not currently available in the command line, please run these commands manually in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "C:\Users\srija\Documents\projects\Fitbit Health Tracker Data Analysis"

# Initialize git repository (if not already initialized)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial full Fitbit Health Tracker Data Analysis project"

# If you have a remote repository set up, push to it
# git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
# git push -u origin main
```

## Notes

- Make sure git is installed and available in your PATH
- You may need to configure git user name and email first:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```
- If this is a new repository, you may want to set up a remote repository first
